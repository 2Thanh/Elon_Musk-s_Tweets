This is a visualization project using a dataset from Kaggle. You can access the dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/elon-musk-tweets. In this notebook, there are important features such as date and text that I use to create charts. I also create new columns such as day_of_week, year, and hour. Additionally, I create a sensitive column using a Transformer model. Thank you for reading my notebook! Correcting grammar in these sentences, I would suggest using the following:
